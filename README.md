# Pig_Game_Vanilla_JS

This is a simple 2-player dice game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current round score and the turn switches. Players can choose to "Hold" to add their current round score to their total score. The first player to reach 20 points wins the game.
